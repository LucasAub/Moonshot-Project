# **Project Pitch: AI-Powered PDF Accessibility Tool**

## **Problem**
Millions of visually impaired users struggle with accessing PDFs due to missing semantic structure, untagged images, incorrect reading order, and poor contrast. Existing solutions are either complex, manual, or fail to automate accessibility compliance.

## **Solution**
We propose an AI-driven tool that automatically detects and fixes accessibility issues in PDFs, making them compliant with WCAG/WAI standards. The tool will:
- Analyze document structure and readability.
- Use OCR to extract text from scanned PDFs.
- Generate AI-powered alternative text for images.
- Reorder content logically for screen readers.
- Enhance color contrast and add missing metadata.

## **How It Works**
1. User uploads a PDF.
2. AI scans and detects accessibility issues.
3. The tool automatically corrects errors.
4. The user downloads a fully accessible PDF.

## **Why This Matters**
- **Fully Automated**: Unlike existing tools, no manual tagging required.
- **AI-Driven**: Uses machine learning to enhance accessibility.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Scalable & Open-Source**: Can be integrated via API into other platforms.

## **Market Potential**
- Government agencies, educational institutions, and businesses need to comply with accessibility laws.
- Accessibility services market projected to grow rapidly.

## **Next Steps**
- Build MVP with Python, PyMuPDF, and Tesseract OCR.
- Develop AI model for alt-text generation.
- Launch beta version and gather user feedback.

## **Impact**
This tool will empower organizations to create truly inclusive content, ensuring equal access to information for visually impaired users worldwide.
