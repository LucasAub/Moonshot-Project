## 4. Algorithm Selection and Justification

### 4.1 PDF Structure Analysis Algorithm
**Chosen Approach:** Block-based content extraction with spatial sorting
**Justification:** PyMuPDF's block-based extraction provides the most reliable method for maintaining document structure while allowing for spatial relationship analysis between elements.

**Implementation Details:**
```python
def process_blocks(page):
    blocks = sorted(
        page.get_text("dict")["blocks"], 
        key=lambda b: (b.get("bbox", [0,0,0,0])[1], b.get("bbox", [0,0,0,0])[0])
    )
```

This algorithm sorts content blocks by vertical position (y-coordinate) first, then horizontal position (x-coordinate), ensuring proper reading order for screen readers.

### 4.2 Title Detection Algorithm
**Chosen Approach:** Font size comparison with document-wide analysis
**Justification:** While not perfect, font size remains the most reliable indicator of heading hierarchy in PDF documents lacking semantic structure.

**Implementation Logic:**
```python
def is_big_title(block, doc):
    max_font = max(span['size'] for line in block['lines'] for span in line['spans'])
    max_doc_font = max(span['size'] for all spans in document)
    return max_font >= max_doc_font - 0.1
```

This approach identifies titles by comparing font sizes within a tolerance range, accounting for minor variations in PDF rendering.

### 4.3 OCR Integration Algorithm
**Chosen Approach:** Tesseract OCR with French language support
**Justification:** Tesseract provides robust, open-source OCR capabilities with multi-language support, essential for generating meaningful alt text for images.

**Process Flow:**
1. Extract image from PDF block
2. Convert to PIL Image format
3. Apply OCR with French language model
4. Generate alt text or fallback to generic description
5. Embed image as base64 data URI in HTML

### 4.4 Link Preservation Algorithm
**Chosen Approach:** Coordinate-based link mapping
**Justification:** This method accurately preserves hyperlinks by mapping PDF coordinate spaces to text spans, maintaining navigation functionality.

**Implementation:**
```python
def find_link_for_span(span_bbox):
    for bbox, uri in links_zones:
        cx, cy = (span_bbox[0] + span_bbox[2])/2, (span_bbox[1] + span_bbox[3])/2
        if bbox contains center point:
            return uri
```

## 5. Testing Strategy and Implementation

### 5.1 Testing Approach
The testing strategy focused on practical, real-world validation using assistive technology rather than automated testing frameworks. The primary testing method involved:

**Screen Reader Testing:**
- Installation and configuration of screen reader software on development machine
- Iterative testing of converted HTML output with screen reader
- Manual validation of content accessibility and navigation
- Continuous refinement based on screen reader feedback

### 5.2 Test Cases and Validation

**Use Case Testing:**
The following scenarios were tested through manual validation:

- Testing of link accessibility with screen readers

### 5.3 Known Limitations and Current Issues

**Table Processing Limitation:**
Currently, the system does not properly handle table structures in PDF documents. Tables are processed as regular text blocks, losing their semantic structure. This represents a significant accessibility gap that requires future development attention.

**Identified Challenges:**
- Complex table structures are not preserved in HTML conversion
