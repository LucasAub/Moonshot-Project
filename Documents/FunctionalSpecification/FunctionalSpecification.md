## **1. Introduction**
### **1.1 Purpose**
The **PDF Accessibility Tool** is designed to help people with disabilities, particularly those with visual impairments, access information in PDF documents. Many PDF files are not created with accessibility in mind, making them difficult or impossible to use with screen readers and other assistive technologies. This desktop application provides a simple, one-step solution to transform inaccessible PDFs into accessible versions that work well with assistive technologies.

### **1.2 Scope**
The **PDF Accessibility Tool** will focus on the following:
- Providing a **simple, user-friendly desktop interface** for selecting PDFs
- **Automatically analyzing** PDFs for accessibility issues
- **Creating fixed versions** of PDFs that are compatible with screen readers and other assistive technologies
- Making the entire process **quick and effortless** for users with disabilities
- Working offline as a **standalone desktop application** without requiring an internet connection
- Installation as a complete, **self-contained package** that doesn't require additional software


The tool will handle the technical complexities internally, requiring no technical knowledge from users. The user simply selects a PDF and receives an accessible version in return.

### **1.3 Intended Audience**
This tool is specifically designed for:
- **People with visual impairments** who use screen readers
- **People with reading disabilities** such as dyslexia
- **Seniors with declining vision**
- **Caregivers and assistants** helping people with disabilities
- **Accessibility advocates** supporting disabled communities
- **Educational support staff** providing accessible materials to students with disabilities
- **Anyone needing accessible PDF documents** for themselves or others

### **1.4 Glossary**
Simple definitions of key terms:
- **Screen Reader**: Software that reads text aloud for visually impaired users
- **Alternative Text (Alt-Text)**: Descriptions of images for visually impaired users
- **Accessible PDF**: A PDF document that can be properly read by screen readers
- **Fixed Version**: An improved version of a PDF with accessibility problems corrected
- **WCAG**: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, standards for digital accessibility
- **Reading Order**: The sequence in which a screen reader presents document content
- **Tagged PDF**: A PDF with proper structure for screen readers to understand

### **1.5 Project Goals**
The primary goals of the PDF Accessibility Tool are to:
1. Remove barriers to information for people with disabilities
2. Create a tool so simple that anyone can use it regardless of technical ability
3. Automatically fix common accessibility problems in PDFs
4. Deliver high-quality accessible documents that work well with assistive technologies
5. Help people with disabilities gain independent access to information
6. Provide a solution that works offline without requiring internet connectivity
