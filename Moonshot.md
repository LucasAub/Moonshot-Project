# 🚀 Moonshot Project: AI-Powered PDF Accessibility Tool

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Many PDFs are inaccessible to visually impaired users because they lack proper structuring, alternative text for images, and semantic markup required for screen readers. Existing solutions are either manual, complex, or fail to automate the entire accessibility process.

## 💡 Innovative Solution
Develop an **AI-powered tool** that automatically detects and fixes accessibility issues in PDFs, making them compliant with **WAI/WCAG** standards. The tool would:

1. **Analyze Accessibility**: Detects text readability, missing alt text, incorrect reading order, poor contrast, and lack of semantic structure.
2. **Automated Fixes**:
   - Uses **OCR** to extract text from scanned PDFs.
   - Adds missing **semantic tags** for headings, paragraphs, and tables.
   - Generates **alt text for images** using AI.
   - Reorders content logically for screen readers.
   - Improves **color contrast** to meet WCAG standards.
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple **upload-and-fix system**, where users upload a PDF and receive an accessible version in return.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
### 1️⃣ **PDF Analysis**
- Extract text using **Tesseract OCR** for scanned documents.
- Use **PDF parsing libraries** (PyMuPDF, PDF.js) to analyze structure.
- Detect non-compliant elements (images without alt text, incorrect heading order, tables without markup).

### 2️⃣ **Automated Remediation**
- Apply **AI models** (OpenAI Vision, Google Cloud Vision) to generate alt text for images.
- Add **semantic tags** (H1-H6, lists, tables) to improve screen reader compatibility.
- Implement **natural language processing (NLP)** to restructure the document’s logical reading order.
- Adjust **color contrast** based on WCAG compliance checks.

### 3️⃣ **Deployment & User Interface**
- **Web-based platform**: Users upload PDFs and receive accessible versions.
- **Browser extension**: Detects non-accessible PDFs online and suggests fixes.
- **API service**: Enables developers to integrate PDF accessibility checks into their applications.

## 🎯 Unique Selling Points (USP)
✅ **Fully Automated** – Unlike existing tools that require manual input, our tool automates accessibility compliance.
✅ **AI-Driven** – Uses machine learning to generate missing accessibility elements.
✅ **User-Friendly** – No technical knowledge needed; simple drag-and-drop functionality.
✅ **Open-Source & Scalable** – Can be integrated into other platforms via API.

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Build a prototype using Python, PyMuPDF, and Tesseract OCR.
2. Train an AI model for generating alt text descriptions.
3. Develop a web interface for easy user interaction.
4. Test with visually impaired users to ensure real-world effectiveness.
5. Scale with cloud-based API services.

## 🌍 Impact
This tool would empower organizations, businesses, and individuals to create **truly inclusive content**, bridging the accessibility gap for visually impaired users and ensuring **equal access to information** in the digital world.
