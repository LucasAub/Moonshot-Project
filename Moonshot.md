# **Project Title**: SmartLearn: AI Learning Planner

## **Summary**
SmartLearn is an app designed to help students and learners achieve their educational goals. By leveraging AI, the app generates personalized study plans based on user goals, time availability, and deadlines. It dynamically adjusts schedules as users progress and provides relevant learning resources to make the process more efficient and effective.

## **Key Features**
1. **Personalized Study Plans**: 
   Users input their learning objectives and time constraints, and the app creates a tailored roadmap for achieving them.
   
2. **Dynamic Progress Tracking**:
   Tracks user progress and recalibrates the plan if they fall behind or complete tasks early.

3. **AI-Powered Resource Suggestions**:
   Recommends helpful tutorials, articles, and exercises based on the user’s goals.

4. **Quiz Integration** (Optional for MVP):
   Offers short quizzes to reinforce knowledge and track comprehension.

5. **Simple and Intuitive Interface**:
   A user-friendly dashboard displays daily tasks, progress tracking, and learning milestones.

## **Target Audience**
- Students preparing for exams or certifications.
- Professionals seeking to upskill or reskill.
- Lifelong learners pursuing hobbies or new skills.

## **Vision**
To make learning smarter and more accessible by helping users plan effectively, stay organized, and achieve their goals with confidence.

# **How SmartLearn Works**

## **1. User Registration and Goal Setup**
- **What the User Does**:
  - Signs up or logs in.
  - Inputs basic details such as:
    - **Subject**: "Learn Python."
    - **Deadline**: "3 months."
    - **Time Available**: "1 hour/day."
    - **Difficulty Level**: Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced (optional).
  - Submits their preferences to create a personalized learning plan.

- **What Happens Behind the Scenes**:
  - The app saves the user profile and preferences to a database.
  - A schedule generation algorithm divides the subject into milestones and daily tasks tailored to the timeline and availability.

## **2. Personalized Study Plan Creation**
- **What the User Sees**:
  - A clear daily or weekly study plan, e.g.:
    - Day 1: Introduction to Python.
    - Day 2: Learn about variables and data types.
    - Day 3: Practice basic exercises.
  - A progress bar showing overall progress.
  - Notifications or reminders to stay on track.

- **What Happens Behind the Scenes**:
  - AI or task-scheduling algorithms organize tasks based on:
    - Time constraints.
    - Task difficulty.
    - Prioritization of foundational concepts first.
  - A roadmap is generated using a predefined database of topics and resources.

## **3. Learning Resources and Quizzes**
- **What the User Sees**:
  - A "Resources" section with curated recommendations such as:
    - YouTube tutorials.
    - Online articles.
    - PDFs or books.
  - Optional quizzes with 5–10 questions to reinforce learning.

- **What Happens Behind the Scenes**:
  - The app fetches relevant resources from APIs or a curated database.
  - Quizzes pull questions from a question bank stored in JSON or SQLite.

## **4. Dynamic Progress Tracking**
- **What the User Does**:
  - Marks tasks as “Complete” upon finishing.
  - Views progress through:
    - A progress bar.
    - A summary of completed and upcoming tasks.
    - Adjusted daily schedules if they fall behind or complete tasks early.

- **What Happens Behind the Scenes**:
  - The app recalculates the workload based on:
    - Completed tasks.
    - Missed deadlines.
    - Remaining time.
  - Algorithms dynamically re-prioritize tasks to keep the user on track.

---

## **5. Notifications and Insights**
- **What the User Sees**:
  - Daily reminders for upcoming tasks.
  - Motivational messages like, “You’re halfway through Python Basics!”
  - Insights such as:
    - "You’re most productive on weekdays."
    - "You’ve studied 10 hours this week."

- **What Happens Behind the Scenes**:
  - The app analyzes user activity (e.g., task completion, login times) to generate insights and reminders.

## **Example User Journey**
1. **Sign-Up**: A student registers and inputs their goal: "Learn Python in 3 months with 1 hour/day."
2. **Personalized Plan**: The app generates a study plan:
   - Day 1: Watch a video on Python basics.
   - Day 2: Practice exercises on variables and data types.
3. **Progress Tracking**: The student marks Day 1 as complete and receives a motivational message: "Great job! Keep going!"
4. **Adjustments**: The student misses Day 2, so the app redistributes tasks for the week to stay on track.
5. **Completion**: After 3 months, the student has completed the plan, reviewed quizzes, and achieved their learning goal.
